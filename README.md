# Boris Bikes

## What does it do?
A replica of London's Boris Bikes.
A person should be able to:

- return a used bike to a docking station
- release a working bike from a docking station
- report a broken bike
- docking stations should not release bikes that are broken
- docking stations should not release a bike if docking station is empty.


## Motivation
This is a project given in my first week at Makers Academy, to help us understand OOP and TDD.


## Code Example
Below are two methods from my DockingStation class. There are more methods than this, but below is just a sample from this class:
```
class DockingStation

  attr_reader :bikes, :capacity

  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 20

  def initialize(capacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY)
    @capacity = capacity
    @bikes = []
  end

  def dock(bike)
    fail 'Docking station full' if full?
    @bikes << bike
    bike
  end

end
```

## Tests
